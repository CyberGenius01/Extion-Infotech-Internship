# **Quantum-Enhanced Federated Learning Project**

## **Overview**
This project combines **Federated Learning (FL)** and **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)** to tackle predictive diagnostics in healthcare. It integrates:
- **Privacy-preserving Federated Learning** for distributed model training without sharing raw data.
- **Quantum-enhanced algorithms**, leveraging quantum computing for better accuracy and efficiency.
- **Neuro-symbolic AI** for improved model interpretability in clinical decision-making.

---

## **Components**

### **1. Data Preparation**
Healthcare data often includes high-dimensional modalities like **medical images** and **text reports**. The data preparation pipeline involves:
1. **Normalization and Imputation:**  
   Missing values are filled using mean/mode (imputation), and features are scaled:
   $$
   x' = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
   $$
   where \( \mu \) and \( \sigma \) are the mean and standard deviation of the feature.

2. **Data Partitioning for Federated Learning:**  
   Data is split into subsets representing different "clients" (e.g., hospitals).

3. **Augmentation:**  
   For images, we apply techniques like rotations, flips, and zoom. For text, **NLP preprocessing** includes tokenization and embedding.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Imputation and normalization
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(X)
X_normalized = scaler.fit_transform(X_imputed)
```

### **2. Federated Learning**
**Federated Learning (FL)** ensures privacy by training models locally on client devices and aggregating updates on a central server. 

#### **Mathematical Model**:
Each client \( k \) computes gradients \( \nabla L_k \) using its local data:
$$
\theta^{t+1} = \sum_{k=1}^N \frac{n_k}{n} \theta_k^{t+1}
$$
Where:
- \( \theta \): Model parameters  
- \( N \): Total clients  
- \( n_k \): Data size of client \( k \)  
- \( n \): Total data size across all clients  

#### **Techniques:**
- **Federated Averaging (FedAvg):** Aggregates local models by weighted average.
- **TensorFlow Federated (TFF):** Library used to implement FL.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
import tensorflow_federated as tff

def model_fn():
    return tff.learning.from_keras_model(
        keras_model=create_model(),
        input_spec=(tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, X_train.shape[1]], dtype=tf.float32),
                    tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None], dtype=tf.float32)),
        loss=tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(),
        metrics=[tf.keras.metrics.BinaryAccuracy()]
    )

iterative_process = tff.learning.build_federated_averaging_process(model_fn)
```

### **3. Privacy and Security**
Healthcare data privacy is ensured using:
1. **Differential Privacy (DP):**  
   Adds noise to model updates:
   $$
   \Delta f + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)
   $$
   where \( \sigma \) controls the noise magnitude.

2. **Homomorphic Encryption (HE):**  
   Encrypts data so operations can be performed on encrypted data without decryption:
   $$
   E(a) + E(b) = E(a + b)
   $$

3. **Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC):**  
   Data is split into shares and securely computed without revealing raw values.

**Code Snippet (DP with TensorFlow):**
```python
from tensorflow_privacy.privacy.optimizers.dp_optimizer_keras import make_keras_optimizer_class

DPSGD = make_keras_optimizer_class(tf.keras.optimizers.SGD)
dp_optimizer = DPSGD(l2_norm_clip=1.0, noise_multiplier=0.5, num_microbatches=64, learning_rate=0.01)
```

### **4. Quantum Machine Learning**
QML enhances federated learning by improving the model's ability to capture complex patterns. 

#### **Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs):**
Uses a **Quantum Kernel** for feature mapping:
$$
K(x, x') = |\langle \phi(x) | \phi(x') \rangle|^2
$$
where \( \phi(x) \) is the quantum state of input \( x \).

#### **Implementation with Qiskit:**
1. Use a **ZZFeatureMap** for encoding classical data into quantum states.
2. Simulate the quantum kernel using `qiskit.Aer`.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
from qiskit import Aer
from qiskit.circuit.library import ZZFeatureMap
from qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.classifiers import QSVC

feature_map = ZZFeatureMap(feature_dimension=X_train.shape[1], reps=2)
quantum_svm = QSVC(quantum_kernel=feature_map)
quantum_svm.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

---

### **5. Deployment**
The model is deployed using a Flask API for secure access. 

#### **Endpoints:**
- `/predict`: Accepts healthcare data as input and returns predictions.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.json['features']
    prediction = model.predict([data]).tolist()
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction})
```

---

### **6. Monitoring and Retraining**
Automated retraining is scheduled using **APScheduler** to incorporate new data while ensuring the model's relevance.

---

## **Mathematics Summary**
1. **Gradient Descent in Federated Learning:**
   $$
   \theta^{t+1} = \theta^t - \eta \nabla L(\theta^t)
   $$

2. **Quantum Kernel for QSVM:**
   $$
   K(x, x') = |\psi(x)^* \psi(x')|^2
   $$

3. **Differential Privacy Noise Addition:**
   $$
   \text{Noisy Update} = \Delta w + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)
   $$

4. **Secure Aggregation:**
   $$
   S = \sum_{i=1}^n \text{Share}(x_i)
   $$
